# About

This repo houses code I use to create shaded relief graphics using the [`rayshader`](https://www.rayshader.com/) R package by [Tyler Morgan-Wall](https://twitter.com/tylermorganwall). I'm walking in the giant steps of Twitter user [flotsam](https://twitter.com/researchremora) whose graphics originally inspired me, and tips + code snippets they shared helped immensely as I was just learning how to make these.

I've been making these graphics for a while and wanted to share code from the start, but I was self-conscious about the state of my code. This repo is an effort to better organize the code so I can have a little more pride in it as I make it public.
