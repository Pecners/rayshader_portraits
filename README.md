# About

This repo houses code I use to create shaded relief graphics using the [`rayshader`](https://www.rayshader.com/) R package by [Tyler Morgan-Wall](https://twitter.com/tylermorganwall). I'm walking in the giant steps of Twitter user [flotsam](https://twitter.com/researchremora) whose graphics originally inspired me, and tips + code snippets they shared helped immensely as I was just learning how to make these.

I've been making these graphics for a while (see my [gallery](https://spencerschien.info/gallery/shaded-relief/)) and wanted to share code from the start, but I was self-conscious about the state of my code. This repo is an effort to better organize my code so I can be confident in sharing it.
